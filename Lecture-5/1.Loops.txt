What is Loop?
Loops in Python are used to repeat actions efficiently.


Types of Loop

1.For Loop:-
For loops is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string or range. 
It allow to execute a block


2.While Loop:-
In Python, a while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.
When the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.

3.Infinite While Loop:-
If we want a block of code to execute infinite number of times then we can use the while loop in Python to do so.


4.Nested Loops:-
Python programming language allows to use one loop inside another loop which is called nested loop.
